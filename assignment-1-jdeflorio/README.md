# assignment-1-jdeflorio

This assignment was to numerically compute the definite integral $\int_a^b \sin(x)/x \ \mathrm{d}x$ using parallelization

I implemental the Monte Carlo method to achieve this, generating a random distrubtution of samples between the limits of integration to be computed with the given function.

Below are graphs of speedup and effeciency results:
